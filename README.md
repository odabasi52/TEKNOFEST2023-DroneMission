# TEKNOFEST_on_Gazebo_Simulation
I was in a team that is developing Fixed Wing and Drone for TEKNOFEST

GUI - I wrote a python script with tkinter which shows data in real-time by getting values with ZMQ
FixedWing - While it is in Qground Mission when it detects specified color it gets loiter mode
Drone - Detect color, center it then go up and down
